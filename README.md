# Nicolas Cuervo - @primercuervo
Hi y'all! I'm Nico and I'm currently an _Embedded Software Developer for 5G Networks_ at Nokia.

:satellite: I'm passionate about **wireless communications**, **Software Defined Radio**, and **clean coding**. :satellite:

When I'm not hacking stuff together :computer: I'm either zwifting :bicyclist: running :runner: or playing :tennis:
## I'm interested in...
Although I devote my affection to wireless communications, I have interests all over the spectrum (see what I did there?):

- RF Engineering
- Software Defined Radio
- Software development and its best practices
- Dev environment tweaking (Vim plugins, tmux, window managers, git hooks, you name it)
- Digital Signal Processing
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning
- FPGA programming for SDR
- GNU Radio
- ROS
- Conan.io

### About the banner
The banner was made using [GNU Radio](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio). For the image "transmission", the spectrum painter of [gr-paint](https://github.com/drmpeg/gr-paint) generated the OFDM sequence, and [gr-fosphor](https://osmocom.org/projects/sdr/wiki/fosphor) was used for visualization.

The GIF was recorded with [peek](https://github.com/phw/peek), and then compressed with [ezgif](https://ezgif.com/).
